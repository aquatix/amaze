=====

Little C/OpenGL project from the dark ages, featuring a little dinosaur, mazes and a bit of fog.

The meat of the project can be found in the `project` directory but it needs some libraries from the other directories (also models, textures etc). The directory tree is a bit haphazard, but the whole project has been put together in a few days back in 2004.
