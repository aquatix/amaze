Done		Choose dino/pony -> dino

Done		Use the model(s) available in the models/dino/ and models/pony/  directories (use the .sgf loader from exercise 2).
Pending		Build the model(s): combine the different body parts by translations, rotations, etc.
Pending		Animate the model(s) in a simple manner (legs and arms should move, in a cycling manner, using some 'sin/cos' functions).
Pending		Apply texture(s) to the model (you are allowed to use random texture coordinates. You may need to change your .sgf loader to support these random texture coordinates).
Pending		Build a 'random' city (e.g. a set of boxes) onto a plane.
Pending		Put a texture onto the buildings and the ground.
Pending		Give the character a trajectory (line, circle, sinus function, data from a file, user control, etc.).
Done		Put in a background color (e.g. sky blue).
TODO		Make the viewpoint (camera) interactive: translation and rotation of the world, allowing an interactive walk through the scene.
Pending		Add a light to the scene.
Pending		Use the framework! Put files where they are supposed to be. If you use extra textures, put them in the texture/ directory. If you add .c or .h files, put them in your project/ directory. If you create your own models put, them in the models/ directory.
TODO		Make the program stand alone! It is not sufficient if your program runs from Visual Studio. It should be able to run from the bin/ directory directly.
TODO		Clean your project before submission. We will not accept submissions over 1 MB (or 2 MB if you use your own textures).
Pending		Your program should use the timer functions for animation and space bar should pause and resume the application.

Done		Add extra texture[s]: reptile skin for dino
TODO		Add fog?
Done		Add fps meter
